"""Fair dispatcher — the WFQ scheduler that sits in front of Prefect.

Why this exists: if the API enqueued every video to Prefect at register-time,
Prefect would run them in submitted order (FIFO) — one user who uploads 50
videos blocks everyone behind them. Instead, videos wait `pending` in Postgres
and THIS loop admits them:

  every DISPATCH_INTERVAL_S:
    slots = DISPATCH_MAX_INFLIGHT - (videos currently queued/running)
    claim up to `slots` pending videos in FAIR order (round-robin across users)
    schedule a Prefect run for each

Because only ~capacity videos are ever handed to Prefect at once, the *waiting
line lives in our DB, fairly ordered* (db.wfq_claim) rather than FIFO inside
Prefect. No user can starve the others. Set ENABLE_FAIR_DISPATCH=false to fall
back to immediate FIFO enqueue (useful for A/B teaching the difference).

Runs as a background thread in worker.py. With one worker that's exact; with
several, each runs a dispatcher — the atomic claim keeps videos handed out once,
at worst mildly over-admitting (harmless; Prefect still caps execution).
